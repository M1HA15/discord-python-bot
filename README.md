# Discord Casual Python Bot

This is the source code of the old Sparky bot.
It was added to 209 Discord servers and was able to please all its users.

Soon I will create a new Discord bot much better than Sparky so you can follow my Github profile for updates!

There may be problems with the code because it hasn't been updated for several years and we don't know if it works on new versions of discord.py
